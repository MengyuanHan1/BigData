## Project Summary

Fill in the sections below to provide a brief summary of your project. Each section should have no more than 100 words. Do not edit any of the headings.

### Problem Statement

What is the problem youâ€™re trying to address using this application?

### End User

**Government departments and international organizations:**

By visualizing flooded areas, affected buildings, and population data, our project enables these departments to quickly and accurately assess the disaster situation. This facilitates effective rescue and reconstruction planning, as well as optimization of future urban development, land use, and drainage systems.

**Insurance companies:**

Our project supports insurance companies by estimating the area of affected buildings, allowing them to accurately assess economic losses and settle claims promptly. This data-driven approach streamlines the claim settlement process and ensures fair compensation for those affected by flood disasters.

### Data

What data are you using?

**Sentinel-1 Satellite Image:** [Sentinel-1](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/sentinel1) collects C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery at a variety of polarizations and resolutions. We use it to Detect flood coverage.

**Sentinel-2 Satellite Image:** [Sentinel-2](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/sentinel-2) is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multispectral imaging mission with a global 5-day revisit frequency. 

**Land Classification:** [ESA WorldCover 10m v200](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ESA_WorldCover_v200#description)
ESA WorldCover10m contains 11 land cover classes based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.

**Population:** [GHSL: Global population surfaces 1975-2030](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JRC_GHSL_P2023A_GHS_POP) contains the spatial distribution of residential population, expressed as the absolute number of inhabitants of the cell.  

### Methodology

How are you using this data to address the problem?

## How it Works

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

``` js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```

You can include images:

and math: $$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$
