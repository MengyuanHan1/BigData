## Al Marj Flood Impact Comprehensive Evaluation System

This project developed an application using Google Earth Engine to conduct an in-depth analysis of the severe flood in Al Marj, Libya in September 2023. The tool integrates multiple data sources, from satellite imagery to land cover data and population grid information, to precisely map the scope and impact of the flooding. The application evaluates the extent to which different land types and populations were affected by the flood and employs random forest classification techniques to identify and assess buildings damaged by the flood. With these comprehensive data, the application provides a holistic view of the disaster-stricken area, including assessments of damaged buildings, land damage, and estimates of the affected population, thereby supporting the formulation of disaster response and recovery strategies.
